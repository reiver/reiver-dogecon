From (a friend of mine) //Anthony Tsui//, noted a part of a discussion at DogeCon —

― John Lyotier asked the question:
― 
―― What gives DogeCoin value?
― 
― Alex Salkeld (a.k.a. DogePreacher) then answered:
― 
―― Shared delusion

🙂

(An amuzing answer that just happens to be applicable to much more than just DogeCoin.)

On //Friday June 22nd, 2018// and //Saturday June 23rd, 2018// Charles Iliya Krempeaux attended [[dogecon]] — a //light-hearted// //just-for-fun// conference, motivated by the [[doge-meme]] and the [[dogecoin]] cryptocurrency.
