From //Daniel Roberts//:

― I really liked something //Nick Tomaino// just said on stage in our panel with //Dan Held// at the //All Markets Summit// (//YahooAMS//):
― huge portion of cryptocurrencies out there are just “meme-based” and “if you can tie a coin to a meme, you can get to a $1 billion market cap.”

AFAIK, //Daniel Roberts// wasn't at DogeCon, but — this post was referenced by a post by //Simon de la Rouvier// ([[log/2018/06/14/1529012500]]), and //Matt Lockyer// referenced //Simon de la Rouvier//'s post with respect to //DogeCon//.

On //Friday June 22nd, 2018// and //Saturday June 23rd, 2018// Charles Iliya Krempeaux attended [[dogecon]] — a //light-hearted// //just-for-fun// conference, motivated by the [[doge-meme]] and the [[dogecoin]] cryptocurrency.
