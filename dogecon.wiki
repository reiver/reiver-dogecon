§ Dogecon

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**Dogecon** was a conference that took place in [[downtown-vancouver]] in **June 2018**.

**Dogecon** was motivated by the [[dogecoin]] cryptocurrency.

Like [[dogecoin]], **Dogecon** was meant to be //light-hearted// and //just-for-fun//.
It was mostly about entertainment — although there were some technical presentations at **Dogecon**.

I attended **Dogecon** with my friend **Anthony Tsui**.
