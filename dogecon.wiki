§ DogeCon

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**DogeCon** was a conference that took place in [[downtown-vancouver]] in **June 2018**.

**DogeCon** was motivated by the [[dogecoin]] cryptocurrency.

Like [[dogecoin]], **DogeCon** was meant to be //light-hearted// and //just-for-fun//.
It was mostly about entertainment — although there were some technical presentations at **DogeCon**.

― Much Conference. Very Vancouver.

I attended **DogeCon** with my friend **Anthony Tsui**.

Other people I know who also attended included:
Bob Summerwill,
Chelsea Palmer,
Matt Lockyer,
and others.
